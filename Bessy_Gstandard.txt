Air conditioning services consist of any service performed on the equipment that delivers cool air to the cabin of your car. the major components of your air conditioning system include the compressor, condenser, evaporator, expansion valve, and refrigerant. there are a variety of problems that can hinder your air conditioner’s ability to generate cold air, it may be as simple as needing to add refrigerant. however, normal wear and tear causes seals, hoses, and fittings to get loose and wear out. when this happens, refrigerant can leak out.
The air conditioning compressor is one of the main components of the air conditioning system and the first step in the complex process that keeps you cool while driving. this mechanism controls temperature output and compresses refrigerant into a gas in order to move it to other parts of the air conditioning system. compressors can be compromised by leaking refrigerant.
The air conditioning drain hose transports condensation that accumulates in a catch pan, out through the bottom of your car. without proper drainage of the catch pan, water can leak onto the floorboard of your car. in other words, this small but important auto part keeps your shoes and carpets dry.
Like a radiator, the job of the air conditioning condenser is to remove the heat the refrigerant accumulated when it was compressed into gas by the compressor. condensers are susceptible to blockage from leaves, dust, and insects, but they may also become internally clogged with metal debris if the compressor has a catastrophic failure.
When refrigerant reaches the air conditioning evaporator, it is a cool, low pressure liquid. the evaporator returns the liquid back into a gas again because gas does a better job of absorbing heat. with the heat gone, the adjacent fan can now blow cool air into the cabin of the car. although evaporators do not fail very often, replacing them can be costly due to the complexity of the labor involved, this component is usually buried deep beneath the instrument panel.
The air conditioning drier contains a desiccant that is designed to absorb moisture that gets into the system from humidity in the air, and is usually built with a filter that traps debris. this component should be changed anytime the air conditioning system is opened for service because desiccants are not effective once they become saturated with moisture.
Holding together the main components of your brake system are a variety of screw assemblies, springs, bolts and caliper brackets. each brake system requires a unique set of hardware for the proper operation of your brake system.
The exhaust pipe is part of your car’s exhaust system. like a chimney on a house, it is designed to release exhaust away from the vehicle and into the air. exhaust pipes connect to the muffler and are often attached to the rear end of the car with a bracket. exhaust pipes are susceptible to damage from rear end collisions, failed brackets, broken seals, and corrosion from age.
Flushing is designed to rid the engine of any residue and debris that clogs up the mechanisms and hinders their performance. to flush the engine, the oil is removed and a chemical is poured in where the oil would normally go so that it flows through various parts of the engine, removing any gunk along the way. after the chemical has done its job and flowed back out of the engine through the bottom, new oil is added. though this type of treatment is seldom needed on newer cars, old cars where the old has not been changed in a long time may benefit from flushing the engine. other systems requiring flush services include, radiator and cooling systems, power steering, transmissions, differentials and brake systems. all of these systems lubricate components that can be equitably as expensive as engines.

Fuel economy is measured under controlled conditions in a laboratory using a standardized test procedure specified by federal law and implemented by the environmental protection agency. manufacturers test their own vehicles, usually pre production prototypes and report the results to the environmental protection agency. the environmental protection agency reviews the results and confirms about ten to fifteen percent of them through their own tests at the national vehicles and fuel emissions laboratory. vehicle is driven on a roller dynamometer the vehicle remains stationary while the driven wheels are allowed to roll and a hose is connected to the tailpipe to collect engine exhaust. the carbon in the exhaust is measured to calculate the amount of fuel burned during the test. this is more accurate than using calculations based on distance traveled and the amount of fuel consumed. five separate test schedules are driven to simulate the driving conditions of city, highway, and hot weather with air conditioning on, high speed driving and acceleration, and cold weather environments. the latter three tests are new for two thousand and eight model year vehicles and will likely result in a decrease in mpg versus the same model tested under the pre two thousand and eight test procedure. driving cycles, city twenty three stops with accelerations to twenty to sixty miles per hour. highway, approximately thirteen minutes of mixed rural and interstate driving with speeds ranging from thirty to sixty miles per hour. high speed, aggressive accelerations to speeds of up to eighty miles per hour with six minutes of driving sixty to eighty miles per hour. air conditioning, ten minutes of accelerations to varying speeds up to sixty miles per hour with the air conditioning on while the vehicle is in an environment of ninety five degrees and approximately forty percent relative humidity. cold, represents urban driving in twenty degree weather. the vehicle is started with the engine cold and driven in simulated stop and go rush hour traffic.
System in which a portion of the exhaust gases is recirculated into the combustion chamber for additional burning. mixing exhaust gases with a new air or fuel mixture helps reduce harmful nitrogen oxide emissions.

Air bags provide vehicle drivers and passengers extra protection in a collision. they are stored in the steering wheel and dashboard and inflate during a serious crash, for example, a head on collision that occurs at over ten miles per hour. they place a protective cushion between the person and the steering wheel, dashboard, and windshield. 
Any driver who operates their vehicle in an unsafe or reckless manner. aggressive driving can endanger passengers, other drivers, pedestrians, and even the drivers themselves.
This is a rule that states that a driver must never drive faster than is safe for present conditions, regardless of the posted speed limit
Any area where the driver’s view is obstructed. this can be caused by anything from poorly aligned rearview mirrors, to the car itself.
The concentration of alcohol in one’s bloodstream, expressed as a percentage. blood alcohol concentration, is used to determine whether a person is legally intoxicated, especially under a driving while intoxicated law. 
The amount of distance required for stopping your car once the brakes have been applied. 
Also known as high occupancy vehicle lanes, they are a traffic control system that designated certain lanes as restricted to vehicles with two or more passengers. these lanes are indicated by a diamond symbol.
Contact between two or more objects, as when two vehicles collide into each other.
Insurance that provides coverage to pay the costs of repair or replacement of your vehicle involved in a collision. 
A vehicle used to transport or deliver goods or passengers for compensation between points on a fixed scheduled route. the vehicle has a gross weight, registered weight, or gross weight rating of more than twenty six thousand pounds, or is designed to transport more than fifteen passengers, including the driver.
There are two kinds of intersections: open uncontrolled and controlled intersections. controlled intersections have traffic control signs or signals. when a driver approaches this type of intersection, he or she must obey the signs, signals, and right of way rules.
Protecting yourself and others from dangerous and unexpected driving situations by using a space management system.
Illegally parking next to another vehicle that is properly parked in a stall or on the street. parking this way prevents other drivers from leaving their parking spaces and stalls the flow of double parking is a traffic violation punishable by fine
Any event or occurrence that directs the driver’s attention away from the task of driving.
