The professional association of transportation industry engineers. The sae sets most automotive industry standards for the testing, measuring, and designing of automobiles and their components.
The distance from the point where the steering axis intersects the ground to the longitudinal line that runs through the center of the tire's contact patch. Also called " steering offset. "
As used by car and driver, the term " sedan " refers to a fixed roof car with at least four doors or any fixed roof two door car with at least thirty three cubic feet of rear interior volume, according to measurements based on sae standard J one thousand one hundred.
A slightly curved leaf spring that is attached to a car's body at its ends and to a suspension component near its middle. One of the two body attachments is a shackle, which allows for changes in the spring's length as it flexes up and down.
An independent rear suspension system in which each wheel hub is located only by a large, roughly triangular arm that pivots at two points. Viewed from the top, the line formed by the two pivots is somewhere between parallel and perpendicular to the car's longitudinal axis.
The numerical representation of a tire's aspect ratio. A fifty series tire has an aspect ratio of zero point fifty.
The mechanism in a transmission linkage that controls the motion of the gear shift lever. The shift gate is usually an internal mechanism, but, in some transmissions including ferrari five speeds and mercedes benz automatics the shift gate is an exposed guide around the shift lever.
A device that converts motion into heat, usually by forcing oil through small internal passages in a tubular housing. Used primarily to dampen suspension oscillations, shock absorbers respond to motion. Their effects, therefore, are most obvious in transient maneuvers.
A spring with a constant spring rate. For example, if a one hundred pound force deflects the spring by one inch, an additional one hundred pounds will deflect it one more inch, and so on until the spring either bottoms or fails.
A large area of smooth, flat pavement used for various handling tests. Roadholding is measured by defining a large diameter circle car and driver uses three hundred feet on the skidpad and measuring the fastest speed at which the car can negotiate the circle without sliding off.
The angular difference between the direction in which a tire is rolling and the plane of its wheel. Slip angle is caused by deflections in the tire's sidewall and tread during cornering. A linear relationship between slip angles and cornering forces indicates an easily controllable tire.
Slang for an automatic transmission.
Single overhead camshaft sohc engines use one camshaft in each cylinder head to operate both the exhaust valves and the intake valves.

An aerodynamic device that changes the direction of airflow in order to reduce lift or aerodynamic drag and or or improve engine cooling.
The opposite of dive, squat is the dipping of a car's rear end that occurs during hard acceleration. Squat is caused by a load transfer from the front to the rear suspension.
The line that intersects the upper and lower steering pivots on a steered wheel. On a car with a strut suspension, the steering axis is defined by the line through the strut mount on top and the ball joint on the bottom.
The general relationship between forces at the steering wheel and handling. Ideally, the steering effort should increase smoothly as the wheel is rotated away from center. In addition, the steering effort should build as the cornering forces at the steered wheels increase. Finally, the friction built into the steering mechanism should be small in comparison with the handling related steering forces.
The relationship between yaw and the steering wheel's position and effort. All three should be proportional and should build up smoothly.

A housing containing a valve to regulate the airflow through the intake manifold. The throttle body is usually located between the air cleaner and the intake plenum.
A form of fuel injection in which the injectors are located at the engine's throttle body, thereby feeding fuel to more than one cylinder. Such an arrangement saves money by using fewer injectors but because it routes both fuel and air through the intake manifold, it eliminates some of the tuning possibilities offered by port fuel injection.
A lateral link in a multilink suspension designed to control a wheel's direction as the suspension moves up and down.
The intentional nonparallel orientation of opposite wheels. Toe in is measured by subtracting the distance between the front edges of a pair of tires from the distance between the rear edges of the same pair of tires. The toe in dimension is positive when the fronts of the tires are turned toward the center of the car.
The changes in the direction of a wheel that occur without driver steering input. Toe steer can be caused by ride steer or by deflections in suspension components caused by the stresses of cornering, accelerating, and or or braking on smooth and bumpy roads.
The rotational equivalent of force, measured in pound feet.
A particular kind of fluid coupling with a third element added to the usual input and output turbines. Called " the stator, " this additional element redirects the churning fluid against the output turbine, increasing torque. This torque increase, however, is achieved at the expense of RPM and efficiency.
A tendency for a car to turn in a particular direction when power is applied. Torque steer is common in front drive cars because reaction forces created in the half shafts can generate uneven steering forces in the front tires.
A spring consisting of a long solid or tubular rod with one end fixed to the chassis and the other twisted by a lever connected to the suspension.
An electronic control system that prevents wheelspin by detecting when a driven wheel is about to break traction, and then reducing engine power and or or applying the appropriate brakes to prevent it.
A driving technique in which the driver begins to brake before entering a turn and then continues to brake as he eases into the corner. As cornering forces build, the driver gradually feathers off the brakes, trading braking power for cornering grip. By increasing the vertical loading and thus the traction at the front tires, trail braking can improve a car's turn in.
A suspension element consisting of a longitudinal member that pivots from the body at its forward end and has a wheel hub rigidly attached to its trailing end. A sufficiently rigid trailing arm can provide all of a wheel's location. In that case it is similar to a semi  trailing arm, except that its pivot axis is exactly perpendicular to the car's longitudinal center line.
A suspension link that is aligned to resist longitudinal motions in a wheel it is mounted to the chassis ahead of the wheel.
A transmission and a differential combined in one integrated assembly.
A gearbox with a number of selectable ratios, used to match the engine's RPM and torque to differing vehicle requirements.

A car frame made up of rigid tubing welded together. Tube frames are easier to manufacture in small quantities than unitized frames.
The term that describes the convex curvature on the side of a car body.
Intake and exhaust systems that, by harnessing the pressure pulses and resonances inside the various passages and chambers of the intake and exhaust manifolds, increase the flow of intake charge into and out of the combustion chambers.
A supercharger powered by an exhaust driven turbine. Turbochargers always use centrifugal flow compressors, which operate efficiently at the high rotational speeds produced by the exhaust turbine.
Within a turbocharger's operating range, lag is the delay between the instant a car's accelerator is depressed and the time the turbocharged engine develops a large fraction of the power available at that point in the engine's power curve.
The moment of transition between driving straight ahead and cornering.
A handling condition in which the slip angle of the front tires is greater than the slip angle of the rears. An understeering car is sometimes said to push, because it resists turning and tends to go straight.
A type of body construction that doesn't require a separate frame to provide structural strength or support for the car's mechanical components. A unitized body can employ monocoque construction, or it can utilize strong structural elements as an integral part of its construction.
A joint that transmits rotary motion between two shafts that aren't in a straight line. Depending on its design, a universal joint can accommodate a large angular variation between its inputs and outputs. The simplest kind of universal joint, called a " hooke joint, " causes the output shaft to speed up and slow down twice for every revolution of the input shaft. This speed fluctuation increases with the angular difference between the shafts.
A high RRPM engine condition in which the valve lifters lose contact with the cam lobes because the valve springs are not strong enough to overcome the momentum of the various valvetrain components. The onset of valve float prevents higher RPM operation. Extended periods of valve float will damage the valvetrain.
Also called a " valve follower " the cylindrically shaped component that presses against the lobe of a camshaft and moves up and down as the cam lobe rotates. Most valve lifters have an oil lubricated hardened face that slides on the cam lobe. So called " roller lifters, " however, have a small roller in contact with the cam lobe thereby reducing the friction between the cam lobe and the lifter.
The collection of parts that make the valves operate. The valvetrain includes the camshafts and all related drive components, the various parts that convert the camshaft's rotary motion into reciprocating motion at the valves, and the valves and their associated parts.
A particular kind of fluid coupling in which the input and output shafts mate with thin, alternately spaced discs in a cylindrical chamber. The chamber is filled with a viscous fluid that tends to cling to the discs, thereby resisting speed differences between the two shafts. Viscous couplings are used to limit the speed difference between the two outputs of a differential, or between the two axles of a car.
A valve used to limit the boost developed in a turbocharger. A waste gate operates by allowing some of the engine's exhaust flow to bypass the turbocharger's turbine section under certain conditions.
An undesirable suspension characteristic in which a wheel or several moves up and down so violently that it actually leaves the ground. Wheel hop can be caused by many problems, including excessive unsprung weight, insufficient shock damping, or poor torsional axle control.

The up  and down distance the piston travels within the cylinder. On a traditional internal combustion engine, the piston makes four strokes during the combustion cycle, only one of which is a power stroke. On the power stroke, the piston is near the top of the cylinder, and it has compressed the air and fuel mixture. The spark plug ignites the mixture, and the force of the explosion pushes the piston down into the cylinder, producing the force that turns the crankshaft. The piston returns to the top of the cylinder to expel the exhaust gases on the second, or exhaust, stroke. It slides down to the bottom of the cylinder during the intake stroke, when the valves open to let in air and fuel. The piston rises to the top of the cylinder on the compression stroke to begin the cycle anew. This process repeats hundreds or thousands of times a minute, resulting in the number of crankshaft revolutions per minute at which the crankshaft is rotating.

The starter is an electric motor that uses power from the battery to turn the flywheel and crankshaft and start the engine. The crankshaft holds the connecting rods and pistons, so it requires a healthy starter motor and strong battery to move all that metal and get the engine going a job that's more difficult in cold weather because the engine oil is thicker. Once the engine is running, the starter motor disengages. Starters wear out and electrical connections can come loose or fail, but starter motors often last for the life of a vehicle. If the engine doesn't crank when trying to start it, the starter may not be the culprit. Instead, the battery could be dead or the ignition switch may be broken. If the lights, wipers, stereo and other electrical accessories work but the engine doesn't crank, then the starter could be the cause.
This is the pump that delivers windshield wiper fluid to your windshield.
Windshield wipers are powered by a small electric motor, usually mounted on the firewall or under the cowl the area under the windshield's base. The motor activates linkage that moves the wiper arms back and forth. On vehicles with a rear window wiper, a separate motor powers the one in the rear. Signs that a wiper motor is about to fail include slow or intermittent operation, wipers that will operate at only one speed, or arms that stop in the middle of the windshield when turned off. If your wipers don't work, the fault could also lie with other parts of the wiper system. In the winter, for example, trying to use the wipers when the blades are stuck to the windshield because of ice or snow can blow the fuse for the motor or trip a circuit breaker. Other possible causes are the interior switch that controls the wipers failing, wires in the system being damaged, or the linkage that pushes and pulls the wiper arms breaking. Moving parts in the linkage may also be stuck from corrosion and or or gunk and need lubrication.
The timing belt is a notched rubber belt, sometimes called a gilmer belt. This belt allows the crankshaft to drive the camshaft, which in turn opens and closes the valves. Without this belt, the engine can't run.
The thermostat cuts off the flow of coolant to the radiator when the engine is cold so that heat generated by the engine warms the coolant. Once the coolant warms to a specific level, a valve in the thermostat is supposed to open so that coolant flows through the radiator to cool off before being pumped back through the engine in a continuous cycle. If a thermostat is open all the time, the coolant will constantly be circulating through the radiator and the engine will take longer to warm up as a result. If a thermostat is stuck in the closed position, the engine could overheat because coolant isn't circulating through the radiator and shedding some heat. In either case, the thermostat should be replaced. Even if the thermostat opens and closes when it's supposed to, the housing gasket could develop a leak and need replacing. The thermostat is typically located where the upper radiator hose enters the engine. Thermostat replacement usually isn't listed in vehicle maintenance schedules, and some mechanics advise that as long as it's working there's no need to replace it. On the other hand, if the coolant is being flushed at, say, one hundred thousand miles, or radiator hoses are being replaced, many repair shops will suggest replacing the thermostat at the same time.
The throttle body is a housing with a valve that regulates airflow into an engine's intake manifold. The throttle body resembles the base of a carburetor, and some low cost fuel injection systems had one or two injectors inside the throttle body instead of an injector for each cylinder, and that was where air mixed with fuel. On multi  point injection systems, with one or more injectors for each cylinder, only air passes through the throttle body. Many drivers think wide open throttle means flooring the gas pedal. That's correct, but flooring the pedal opens a throttle blade as wide as it can go, allowing more air into the engine. When more air goes in, more gas or diesel goes into the engine with it, producing more power and speed. Dirt can build up in a throttle body and cause sluggish acceleration, hard starting or stalling, so the body needs to be cleaned as part of fuel system maintenance.
The throttle position sensor monitors how far open the throttle valve or blade is open, which is determined by how far down the accelerator pedal has been pushed. The throttle position controls the amount of air that flows into an engine's intake manifold when it's opened wide more air flows in when it's nearly closed, little air flows in. The position of the throttle and how quickly it's opening or closing is transmitted to the engine control module, and that information is among the factors the computer uses to decide how much fuel is injected into the engine and the spark timing. The TPS is usually mounted on the throttle body the housing that contains the throttle valve. When a TPS malfunctions it can trigger a check engine warning light or cause the engine to idle roughly, surge, hesitate or stall because the engine control module doesn't know what the throttle position is and can't correctly set the fuel mixture or ignition timing.
The pumping of an engine's pistons creates a vacuum in the cylinders, and that vacuum is filled by air drawn in through the intake system. If leaks develop in hoses or engine parts downstream from the air intake, that means additional air is going into the engine that's not being read by the engine computer, which determines how much fuel to inject into the cylinders based on the amount of air coming in. The result is an incorrect air fuel mixture than can create a number of problems, such as hard starting, a rough idle, hesitation, misfiring or a drop in fuel economy issues that could, without proper diagnosis, seem to have other causes, such as incorrect ignition timing or fouled spark plugs. A vacuum leak can trigger a check engine light because the fuel system is running too lean, meaning it has a greater mix of air than is ideal. Vacuum leaks can develop in many locations, including the intake manifold, throttle body evaporative emissions system, power brake booster, and several other places, because some vehicles have a multitude of vacuum hoses.
The transmission serves three main roles it connects and disconnects the motor from the rest of the drivetrain drive shafts, axles, wheels. It provides gearing that allows the engine's limited range of operation to take the car from a standstill to high speeds. It allows the driver to change direction from forward to backward. Additionally, transmissions can serve to hold the car in place when it's off, either in the park setting automatics or by remaining in gear manuals. Thanks to tech advancements for both transmissions and lubricants, many of today's transmissions require less maintenance, or less frequent maintenance, than they used to. See more detail in the automatic transmission and manual transmission entries.
Spark plugs, which screw into the top of an engine's cylinders, create the electric spark required to ignite the compressed air fuel mixture in gas powered engines. The right type of plug and the size of the gap between the electrodes at the tip are specified by the automaker, and using the right ones are crucial to proper performance. A fouled, worn or loose plug can cause rough running or abnormal noises. Longer replacement intervals, typically around one hundred thousand miles in newer cars, have simplified plug maintenance, but they've also led manufacturers to justify making them more labor intensive and expensive than ever to replace.
Officially a macpherson strut, named after its creator, a strut is a type of shock absorber that has a structural role in a vehicle's suspension. The strut includes a shock absorber element, but it also serves to position the wheels, a task handled by control arms in a conventional suspension design that employs dedicated shock absorbers. Like shocks, struts can lose their ability to damp bounces and compromise the car's roadholding and braking. Mechanics might spot oil leaking from the strut, which means the component is on its way out and should be replaced. Uneven tire wear is another potential sign that the shock absorber component is failing. Because of their size and complexity, struts are more expensive to replace than shock absorbers.
On many vehicles with strut type suspension designs, the front struts which include the springs and shock absorbers are mounted with bearings or bearing plates that serve as the upper pivot points for the steering. The bearings can wear out from long term use, corrosion, impact or collision damage, and other factors. When they do, they often make knocking or clunking noises over bumps or in turns, or the steering becomes stiff or snaps back toward center when the driver lets go of the steering wheel. Bad strut bearings can also cause alignment issues and uneven tire wear. Many mechanics recommend that strut bearings be replaced whenever struts are replaced so worn bearings don't affect suspension or steering performance. Some replacement parts come as a complete assembly with struts, springs, bearing plates and mounting hardware. In addition, strut assemblies should be replaced in pairs, not just one side at a time, and the vehicle should also get a wheel alignment after the struts and or or bearing plates are replaced. One advantage of buying a complete strut assembly instead of individual parts is that with the complete kit, removing and installing the strut assembly doesn't require a spring compressor, a tool that can cause serious injury when not used properly.
Sway bar end links are the attachment points between a sway bar and suspension members. Also known as a stabilizer bar or anti  roll bar, the sway bar connects suspension components on either side of the car to minimize body leaning in turns. Though the sway bars themselves are made of long lasting, durable steel, the end links incorporate bushings that can fail with age and wear. That can introduce play that causes noise, compromises the sway bar's effectiveness and may lead to separation. Inboard sway bar bushings, which serve as a hinge, also must be maintained properly.
Tie rods connect either end of the steering rack to the steering knuckles on which the front wheels pivot when the steering wheel is turned. The tie rod has two sections threaded together, so their length can be adjusted and the front wheels aligned. The outer section, typically called the tie rod end, is most susceptible to wear and failure. Though tie rod ends historically required regular lubrication, they are among many aspects of a modern vehicle's chassis that are now maintenance free. When they fail, however, they can throw off the car's alignment, cause premature tire wear or, in the worst cases, separate and cause a loss of control.
On four wheel drive vehicles, the transfer case contains gears that connect a second drive shaft to send power to all four wheels instead of just the front or rear ones. The transfer case on some vehicles, particularly those intended for off road use, are engaged by a separate gear lever or electric buttons or a rotary switch on the dashboard. Most off road 4WD vehicles have transfer case positions for rear wheel drive 4WD high, for on road operation and 4WD low, for off road and demanding on road use. All  wheel drive vehicles often don't have a transfer case lever or switch instead, awd engages or disengages automatically based on driving conditions. Some transfer cases have the ability to send all the power to either the front or rear when needed.
Depending on the vehicle, proper wheel alignment involves setting the camber inward or outward tilt of the wheels when looking head on, caster wheel tilt front or back looking from the side and toe in or toe out looking down at the wheels from above. The adjustments are measured in fractions of an inch and require specialized alignment equipment. Wheel alignment isn't usually listed by vehicle manufacturers on the recommended maintenance schedule, so how often it should be done is open ended. If your vehicle tracks as straight as an arrow, you're wheels likely are properly aligned. Even so, it's a good idea to have your alignment checked annually, such as when you have your tires rotated.
Wheels turning at eight hundred revolutions per mile can generate a lot of friction and heat. Roller type or ball bearings packed in grease inside all four wheel hubs allow wheels to spin freely without generating excessive heat while supporting the weight of the vehicle. In addition, by reducing friction they improve fuel economy. Most wheel bearings are sealed and don't need regular maintenance, but some need fresh grease periodically. They typically last more than one hundred thousand miles. Bearings can also be damaged by hitting potholes or curbs or in an accident. They can also fail, often because seals wear out and allow grease to escape and dirt and moisture to enter. When they do fail, they often make a roaring or rumbling noise. On vehicles with sealed bearings, the entire hub assembly must be replaced when the bearings fail.
The shock is a suspension component that controls the up  and down motion of a vehicle's wheels. Though the devices provide some shock absorption, the job of absorbing shocks is handled mostly by the springs. More accurately called dampers, shocks damp excessive motion, keeping the vehicle's body from bouncing down the road. Cars with worn out shock absorbers illustrate what the devices are meant to do, because they tend to bounce continuously. Worn out shocks compromise a car's roadholding and braking. The bounce test is a time honored method of checking shock absorber health, but mechanics might also spot oil leaking from the shock, which means the component is starting to fail and should be replaced. Uneven tire wear is another sign of shock failure.
The steering gearbox contains the gears that transmit the driver's steering inputs to the steering linkage that turns the wheels, and it multiplies the driver's steering changes so that the front wheels move more than the steering wheel. Most car based vehicles use rack and pinion steering in which the steering wheel turns a pinion gear that moves on a rack to turn the front wheels. Others use recirculating ball systems in which ball bearings are mounted on a worm type steering gear. Though steering gears often last for the life of a vehicle, the gearbox can develop leaks or the gearbox case can crack. Among the signs that a steering gearbox needs repair or replacement are increased or jerky steering effort, and the steering becoming loose and showing excessive play.
Part of a rack and pinion steering system, the rack is a bar parallel to the front axle that moves left or right when the steering wheel is turned, aiming the front wheels in the correct direction. The pinion is a small gear at the end of the vehicle's steering column that engages the rack. Though steering racks are hearty, they sometimes require replacement. Signs of a failing rack include difficulty turning the steering wheel in one direction but not the other, jerkiness of motion or noises.

A supercharger is an air compressor used to increase the pressure, temperature, and density of air supplied to an engine. Having a greater mass of oxygen accelerates fuel burning, which increases the power produced by the engine. When the supercharger's power source is a turbine, that supercharger is said to be a turbosupercharger turbo for short.
Your car's suspension is designed to maximize friction between the tires and the road so that there is good stability and handling while driving. Suspension allows the frame and body of the car to ride undisturbed as the wheels follow the irregularities bumps, cracks, holes, debris of the road.
What is a tail light? Tail lights are mounted to the rear of the car above the bumper. They are red in color and have accompanying white lights beside them to indicate when the vehicle is in reverse. When you're on the road, tail lights make other car's aware of your presence so that you can travel safely in the dark. Also, the red color of the tail lights shines more brightly whenever you are braking so that other cars know to slow down as well.
The tail pipe is part of your car's exhaust system. Like a chimney on a house, it is designed to release exhaust away from the vehicle and into the air. Exhaust pipes connect to the muffler and are often attached to the rear end of the car with a bracket. Exhaust pipes are susceptible to damage from rear end collisions, failed brackets, broken seals, and corrosion from age.
The thermostat resides between the engine and the radiator, regulating engine temperature. When the engine is cold, the valve of the thermostat is held shut to prevent coolant into the radiator. When the engine heats up, the valve opens so that coolant can circulate through the engine and cool the system. When a car overheats, it could be the result of a faulty thermostat.
The throttle system regulates the amount of air entering the engine, indirectly controlling the fuel air mixture needed for engine power. When you press your foot on the accelerator lightly, the throttle valve opens slightly to let in a small amount of air. Conversely, if you floor it and press down hard on the gas pedal, the throttle opens wide to let in more air, signaling to the car you want to go fast.
Your car's timing belt controls the camshaft, which opens and closes the intake and exhaust valves of the car. While timing belts have a pretty long life span, they will eventually wear out. This will cause the engine to fail.
The timing belt tensioner maintains the proper tension on the timing belt. Timing belt failures are usually a result of a worn timing belt tensioner.
Tire diameter is determined by the width, ratio, radial and rim. The measurements can be found stamped on every tire.
Tire rotation is the act of moving the tires on the car from one position to another in order to extend the life of the tires by helping them wear more evenly.
Tune up refers to service and maintenance on your car. In the past, cars literally needed " tuning " to recalibrate settings. Newer cars of today have different systems, some that self adjust. Despite all that, you car's oil still needs to be changed regularly, fluids need to be topped off, brakes need to be inspected, and tires need to be rotated. There are also many hoses and belts that should be regularly examined for wear to prevent more serious maintenance issues.
Torque is a measure of how much force on an object causes that object to rotate, and is often expressed in pounds of power. In simpler terms, torque determines how fast a car can accelerate. For example, you'll hear a manufacturer boast, this car can go from zero to sixty MPH in four seconds.
When the road is wet, traction control helps limit tire slip when you're accelerating from a stop, so that you're wheels don't peel out or cause you to lose control.
A transaxle combines the transmission, differential, and ancillary systems around the axle into one integrated assembly. You will usually find transaxle configurations in cars where the engine is placed at the same end of the car as the drive wheels. For instance, when you have a front engine, front wheel drive configuration, or a rear engine, rear wheel drive configuration, the design will use a transaxle.
The transmission transfers the output of the engine to the drive wheels of the car. Your car's transmission is usually connected to the crankshaft via a flywheel and or or clutch. The engine's power is transmitted from the driveshaft to the differentials, which causes the wheels on the axle to rotate.
Transmission fluid is highly specialized oil designed for use in automatic transmissions. This fluid assists proper valve operation, reduces brake band friction, and lubricates the torque converter and gears
U bolts are used to hold springs to the front and rear axles of your car. They are also used to attach the body of a truck to its frame. Over time, U bolts can become loose or worn and should periodically be tightened.
Shaped like a U and aptly named, the U joint connects the two shafts of the driveshaft. Over time, lubrication inside the U joint will wear out causing the gears to rub against one another and damage the mechanism.
Underinflation of a tire affects driving performance, wears the tire out more quickly and reduces fuel efficiency. An under inflated tire can't maintain its shape and becomes flatter than intended while in contact with the road. Not only does this put you at risk of getting a flat tire, it significantly shortens the life of your tire. That's why you should frequently check your tire pressure to make sure all four contain the prescribed air pressure usually indicated on a sticker on the interior edge of the car door.
Underbody refers to the belly of your car, the underside that sits closest to the road. Everyday as you drive, rocks, road debris, and salt on snowy roads brushes up against the underbody of your car. When you bring your car in for service, it's raised on a rack so that the mechanic can access certain components and inspect the underside of the car for damage or rust in order to prevent more serious conditions from developing.
Understeer is what happens when your car turns less than the amount you thought it would, causing you to veer off the road.
Unlike traditional lines or hoses that transport material, vacuum lines and hoses work to pull once something has been pushed. For example, when you push down on your brakes, a mechanism is required to pull them back up. Vacuum lines and hoses create reverse pressure to move these kinds of parts.
A vacuum gage is used for diagnostic purposes and is an essential tool in tuning a carburetor in order to find the proper idle mixture of fuel air.
There are a variety of valves on your car usually referred to as a " car valve " or " car valves ". The intake valve allows the fuel air mixture into the combustion chamber of the engine, while the exhaust valve releases the burnt fuel air mixture into the exhaust system. When valves wear out or fail, the cylinder head must be removed and taken apart. This is a fairly involved process that requires resurfacing, pressure testing, and precision work.
A V belt is the rubber belt that drives the alternator, air conditioning compressor, power steering pump and waterpump. It's called a V belt because of its V shaped cross  section. All belts wear out over time and need to be replaced. If you notice cracks or frayed peeling rubber, you should have the belt changed immediately to avoid serious engine damage that could occur.
The advantage of a variable gear ratio steering assembly is that it adjusts to the ideal steering condition for whatever the car's speed happens to be. When traveling at highway speeds, the car's steering becomes less sensitive to small movements of the wheel, whereas when you're driving at slower speeds or parking, the steering becomes highly responsive to small movements of the wheel.
Whenever you brake, the rotor becomes very hot from the friction caused by the brake pad pressing against it. A ventilated rotor helps reduce the heat coming off the rotor for the purpose of making the brakes last longer. The drawback is that ventilated rotors cost more.
Using centrifugal force, the water pump pumps liquid from the engine and cylinder head to the radiator, and then back into the pump. If you are leaking coolant or your car is overheating, you may have a water pump problem.
Wheel alignment is a service that adjusts the angle of the wheels so your car drives straight without pulling to one side or another. Hitting the curb when parking or bouncing in and out of potholes ruins the alignment on your car. This causes uneven tread wear on your tires and shortens the life of the tires.
The wheelbase of a car equals the distance between its front and rear wheels. Its measurement is particularly important to performance cars, as the length of the wheelbase affects weight distribution and aerodynamics.
Wheel bearings, which are located on the wheel hub, are components that help decrease friction when the wheel is turning. Although wheel bearings are sealed, wear can damage the seal and allow debris and moisture inside. When this happens, the bearings will fail and create wheel noise.
What does a wheel cylinder do? In a drum brake system, the wheel cylinder puts pressure on the brake shoes, which when pressed against the drum, slows down and stops the vehicle. The cylinder is connected to the shoes by small rods. In older cars, the cylinders may leak and hinder braking power, but cylinders are relatively inexpensive to replace.
Wheel lug nuts are a tapered nut used to fasten the wheel to the threaded wheel studs connected to your car's axle. Wheel lug bolts fasten the wheel of your car to wheel's hub or brake drum.
Wheel service may include new tires with balancing and alignment, inspection of shocks and struts, a tire rotation of your existing tires to extend their lifespan, or removing the wheels for a brake check.
Windshield wiper fluid is a liquid used to clean the glass of your windshield. It is held in a plastic container and dispensed through jets pointed at the windshield via a switch or lever on your steering wheel. Because clean windshields are important to driving safely, you should always make sure you have a good supply of windshield wiper fluid in its container.
