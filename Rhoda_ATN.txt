For example, the residual value of a vehicle May be zero point sixty five, or sixty five percent of its MSRP at the end of the lease term. In this example, a car with an MSRP of twenty thousand dollars is estimated to be worth thirteen thousand dollars at the end of the lease term. Residual value May be a negotiable figure. This should be clearly stated in the lease. It is one of the elements used in determining the monthly lease payment and also in deciding whether to buy the vehicle at term end.

A protective steel cage to prevent driver injury during a rollover.
The type of vehicle impact in which the car or truck rolls over on its side, onto its roof, or turns over completely. The biggest cause of injury in a rollover is ejection of the occupant or any part of the occupant. Rollover is a greater risk in any sport utility vehicle because of its high center of gravity than in a minivan, pickup truck or passenger car. Rollover can occur immediately upon impact or in the seconds after an impact, which makes it more difficult to protect occupants with traditional airbags. Inflatable tubular restraints and similar designs that stay inflated longer than traditional airbags will be more effective in rollover situations.
Under a rule of seventy eight loan, the interest over the entire life of the loan is divided into seventy eight equal pieces. The first monthly payment consists of twelve of these pieces, the next of eleven pieces and the rest principal, the third of ten interest pieces and the rest principal, and so on to the twelfth payment, which includes only one seventy eight of the interest. Under this type of loan, all the interest due is paid during the first year, and all future payments go toward reducing the principal. A rule of seventy eight loan insures that the financier will earn its profit immediately but leaves the borrower with less equity in the early years of the loan. Many dealers advertise that their loans are not of this type.
This indicates that something May be wrong on the track, but the cars are allowed to stay, running at a reduced speed. A quick check by the officials usually resolves the issue and the green light comes back on.

RPM range over which an engine delivers a substantial portion of its peak power. The power band generally extends from slightly below the engine's torque peak to slightly above its power peak.
Power takeoff refers to using the vehicle's power train as a power source to perform some work other than moving the vehicle. Examples of this work include operating auxiliary equipment such as a wrecker and snowplow lifts, dump bodies, hydraulic or pneumatic tools and so on. The pto unit is located between the power train and the device it powers. When a vehicle is doing this work while it is not moving, keep in mind that it is also deprived of the cooling benefits airflow provides. Because of this, it is important not to block the front grille or bumper openings. Specific precautions are listed in the body builders layout book. While ford does not offer the actual pto units, ford F series super duty engineers worked closely with two pto after market suppliers parker chelsea and muncie during development of the truck. This work helped create two different ford specific after market units that bolt directly onto the transmission's power takeoff interface the interface is standard on F series super duty models equipped with a manual transmission, optional with automatic transmission.
Power takeoff pto provision is an added benefit for customers with specific auxiliary power needs. It enables up fitters to supply auxiliary power to hydraulically driven accessories such as dump bodies, sprayers, pumps, generators, etcetera front mounted, front powered equipment is often powered by a direct drive shaft from the front of the engine. The adaptation of the vehicle to allow this installation is called the power takeoff provision. This includes an adapter plate on the engine, and in some instances clearance through the grille or front end sheet metal. An optional front frame extension for mounting equipment is available on all models except the pro loader. The F six hundred and fifty and F seven hundred and fifty extensions are bolted on, while the F 750S extension has an integral extension of the frame rail.

There are two manifolds in a car an intake manifold that distributes the fuel air mixture to the cylinders and an exhaust manifold that delivers exhaust out the rear of the car. With wear and tear, manifolds can suffer from cracks and faulty gaskets.
The manifold heat control valve forces hot exhaust gases up around the base of the carburetor and intake manifold to warm the fuel air mixture. If additional heat is not supplied, the gasoline can easily condense back into a liquid as the fuel air mixture comes in contact with the inner surfaces of the intake manifold. This improper fuel mixture typically causes rough idle, reduced power on acceleration, and engine stall.
Before the invention of power brakes, cars were designed with manual brakes. They are still the preference of race car, sports car, and performance car drivers because they require more precise interaction with the brake pedal.
A manual transmission car, also known as a stick shift, is a type of transmission that requires the driver to change gears manually using a clutch pedal. Manual transmissions have the advantage of giving you a little extra power on initial acceleration. They can also offer slightly better gas mileage than automatic transmission vehicles. However, in high traffic conditions, they are more tiresome to drive.
The master cylinder in your brake system converts non  hydraulic pressure into hydraulic pressure your wheel cylinders use to push your brake pads against the rotors to slow down and stop the vehicle. Problems can occur if there is not enough hydraulic fluid in the cylinder as a result of a leak.
Motor oil lubricates various parts of your car's engine, thereby reducing friction so that the parts move easier. Engine oil also cleans the engine, inhibits corrosion and helps cool the engine by carrying heat away from moving parts.
Mounting tires is the act of placing tires on the wheels or rims and installing them onto the axels of the car. When this is done, the wheels require balancing to ensure that there are no spots on the tire that will wear unevenly. This is accomplished using a special machine that determines when the wheel and the center of gravity are identical to the axis of rotation.
Mpg stands for miles per gallon, a measurement that lets you calculate how many miles you can travel on one gallon of gas. Each car is designed with a maximum MPG capacity, but the actual number of miles your car gets per mile varies greatly due to driving conditions. Driving on city streets or in traffic where you stop and go a lot diminishes the amount of miles per gallon your car will travel.
The muffler is a device designed to limit the amount of noise emitted from your car's exhaust system. Over time, mufflers can suffer from corrosion or become damaged by rocks and debris in the road because of their placement on the undercarriage of the car.
Multigrade oil is designed for people living in cold climates where the temperatures drop below freezing. Multigrade oil is thinner in cold temperatures, which allows it to move through the engine better. Conversely, this oil becomes thicker in temperatures above 100AAÂAA F, which helps keep the engine cooler.
When a car is in neutral, it is temporarily disengaged from the gearbox. This allows you to push a stalled car and it allows you to take your foot off the clutch in a manual transmission vehicle while you are at a stop.
When a vehicle turns at a rate exactly proportional to the rate at which the steering wheel is turned, it is said to have neutral steering.
Nitrogen oxide is a toxic by product of internal combustion. When dissolved in moisture in the environment nitrogen oxide causes acid rain and pollution. The catalytic converter in your car helps reduce the amount of nox present in your exhaust.
The odometer is the instrument on your dashboard that displays how many total miles the vehicle has traveled. It is illegal to tamper with your odometer and display fraudulent mileage to a prospective buyer.
Oil lubricates various parts of your car's engine, thereby reducing friction so that the parts move easier. Engine oil also cleans the engine, inhibits corrosion and helps cool the engine by carrying heat away from moving parts. Gears and other mechanisms in your car also require oil for lubrication.
An oil change is the act of removing the used oil in your engine and replacing it with new, clean oil. Over time, oil breaks down and gets dirty. These factors make oil much less slippery and less effective at their job of lubricating engine parts. That's why it's important to change your oil according your car's specifications.
The oil filter is designed to remove contaminants and debris from your engine's oil so that they don't get circulated into the engine where they can cause damage.
The oil pump circulates engine oil to the rotating bearings, the sliding pistons, and the camshaft of your car's engine. If your engine is running hot, oil pressure is low, or you're hearing engine noises, there could be a problem with the oil pump.
The overdrive setting on your car lets you drive at a steady speed while the engine reduces its RPM. This reduces wear on your engine and provides for better fuel efficiency.
The overhead camshaft is a valvetrain configuration where the camshaft is located above the combustion chambers. This configuration delivers better engine performance and more speed to the vehicle. It is also easier for mechanics to work on this type of configuration.
The overhead valve is a type of piston engine that places the camshaft within the cylinder block and uses pushrods to move the rocker arms, which in turn opens and closes the valve. While the overhead valve configuration offers comparable performance to the overhead camshaft design when the engine is not pushed to high RPMS, it is a more cumbersome design that requires more mechanical labor when problems arise.
Overheating is when your car's engine is running too hot. Too little antifreeze can cause this problem, particularly if the antifreeze is leaking or not circulating through the system properly because of a faulty uptake hose. If your engine is overheating, you should pull over, stop the car, and let the engine cool down. If you are not in a position to immediately stop the car, you should turn the heater on, which will temporarily cool the engine a bit until you can pull over and assess the problem.
Overload shocks are designed for vehicles that carry heavy loads. These shocks provide extra cushioning and spring so that the struts can handle the car's weight and still provide a safe, comfortable ride.
Oversteer... It looks great in car commercials when the back end of a car is skidding sideways on a shiny surface where there are no obstacles around. But it's not so good for ordinary drivers! Oversteer occurs when the rear tires of a car lose their grip on the road when heading into a turn. When that happens, the back end skids out. To avoid this and the serious damage it can cause, you should approach turns slowly and cautiously, especially in the rain.
Oxidation is the interaction of oxygen with other substances. Rust is a common side effect of oxidation, and when it comes to cars, oxidation damages paint and the metal beneath it. Sealants on paint help combat this naturally occurring process, but over time oxidation can damage your car's parts and appearance.
The oxygen sensor is part of your car's emissions control system. It is located in the exhaust pipe and designed to ensure your engine is receiving the correct fuel air mixture by measuring the ratio contained within the exhaust.
Parking lights, the two lights located on the sides of the front grille and sometimes rear and side panels of the car, were originally designed to offer illumination on cars parked alongside a dark road, so that other drivers could see them. In most cars, the switch that turns on the headlights also turns on the parking lights. Today, these lights are handy for when you need some degree of illumination but don't need the full power of your car's headlight lamps.
The parking brake, also known as the emergency brake, is designed to keep the car motionless when it is parked. This is particularly important for manual transmission vehicles.
Pcv stands for positive crankcase ventilation. Unburned fuel vapors, other combustion byproducts, and moisture are contained in the crankcase until they can be filtered and redistributed back into the intake manifold to be reburned by the engine. The main components of this system include a valve, hoses, and an air filter. The PCV valve restricts the amount of air that's siphoned from the crankcase into the intake manifold. The PCV filter introduces clean air through a hose to the engine.
A pinion is a small gear located in the drivetrain of the car, which moves the larger gear that turns the steering wheel. Pinion gears are also used in rear differentials.
A piston ring is a ring that fits into a groove on the exterior of the piston. This ring serves to seal the combustion chamber so that gasses can't escape, transfer heat from the piston to the cylinder, and regulate oil consumption. Unless you are putting undue stress on your engine, the piston ring usually lasts the lifetime of your car.
Power steering minimizes the amount of effort it takes to turn your steering wheel. Nearly all newer model cars have power steering.
Power steering fluid is a hydraulic fluid used by the pump in your power steering system. It should be checked regularly to make sure there is enough pressure in the pump to support the rack and pinion.
There are generally two hoses in the power steering system one that takes hydraulic fluid from the pump to the rack, and another that takes fluid from the rack back to the pump. As with any hoses, cracks and leaks can develop over time, thereby compromising your power steering and components.
The purge valve releases fuel vapors from the canister into the intake. When the valve is faulty, your emissions system will not work properly and this will cause stress on the engine.
A radial tire is a tire design that utilizes plies arranged at a ninety degree angle to the direction of travel. These plies are strong cords made of polyester, steel and other materials that help the tire hold its shape by preventing the rubber from stretching.
The radiator transfers heat from the hot liquid coolant, through its tubes, to the air blown through the fan. This process helps cool the engine. Problems that can go wrong with the radiator include leaks in the hoses, leaks in the radiator itself, a faulty fan, or obstructions in the cooling system.
Made of aluminum or copper, the radiator core is comprised of rows of tubes and serpentine fins that work to transfer heat to the cooling fan.
Your car's radiator hoses attach from the radiator to the engine, and from the radiator to the waterpump. As with any hoses under the hood, over time hoses can develop leaks at the seal and need to be replaced.
Rear brakes are typically drum brakes. This type of brakes has more parts than disc brakes and is harder to service, but they are less expensive to manufacture, and they easily incorporate an emergency brake mechanism. With drum brakes, fluid is forced into the wheel cylinder, which pushes the brake shoes against the drum, which is attached to the wheel. This friction causes the wheel and car to stop.
There are two kinds of rear defrosters one blows hot air against the rear window the other is an application of thin lines crossing through your back window. These lines are actually small heating elements that slowly warm your window from the inside out.
In rear wheel drive cars, the back wheels do the pushing while the front wheels do the steering. This distributes the load of the car across all four tires. The advantage of having better weight balance overall is that it extends the life of your tires. You also get quicker acceleration and slightly better stopping capability.
A reservoir is a holding receptacle for liquid. The most important reservoir in your car is the container that holds your coolant for the radiator.
RPM stands for revolutions per minute. In your car, RPM is used to measure the output of the engine. Anything below eight hundred RPM and your car is in idle. One thousand five thousand RPM indicates standard output for accelerating and driving. Five thousand plus RPM exceeds standard output and May put stress on your engine.
The rotor is the brake disk that attaches to the wheel of the car. In a disc brake system, the brake pad is pressed against the rotor with a set of calipers. The friction it causes enables the car to slow down and stop. If you let your brake pads wear out without replacing them, you risk damaging the rotor.
Rust and corrosion inhibitors are chemical compounds that protect against rust and corrosion on the exterior of metal parts and structural components
R one hundred and thirty four is a type of refrigerant used in car air conditioning systems. It was designed to replace freon, which is now banned because it depletes ozone in the environment.
