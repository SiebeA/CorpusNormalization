SA IT COSTS FIVE OR FIVE POINT ZERO ZERO DOLLARS EURO
THE BRAND IS CALLED BMW A GERMAN ORGANIZATION
SHOULD I SERVICE MY TRANSMISSION EVEN THOUGH IT IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A LIFETIME FLUID
IN THESE TIMES OF A DOWN ECONOMY PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE IS BEING PUT ON HOLD BY MANY PEOPLE TRYING TO STRETCH A PAYCHECK
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND BUT IN THIS CASE DO NOT AGREE THIS IS THE BEST CHOICE
ONE DOLLAR SPENT ON MAINTENANCE TODAY MAY WELL SAVE YOU TEN DOLLARS TOMORROW
MANY MANUFACTURERS ARE TRYING TO SHOW LOWER ANNUAL MAINTENANCE COSTS BY USING WHAT THEY CALL LIFETIME FLUIDS
I ALWAYS ASK WHO'S LIFETIME THE TRANSMISSION'S LIFETIME
WHAT IS BLACK DEATH
BLACK DEATH IS A TERM COINED BY TECHNICIANS AND MECHANICS THAT REFERS TO THE BREAKDOWN OF THE REFRIGERANT'S LUBRICANT
WHEN THIS HAPPENS A BLACK RESIDUE BUILDS UP INSIDE THE COMPRESSOR DUE TO THE EXCESSIVE WEAR CAUSED BY THE LACK OF LUBRICANT
THIS RESIDUE CONSISTS OF A COMBINATION OF THE COMPRESSOR'S ALUMINUM SHAVINGS AND SOLDER FLUX FROM THE CONDENSER
ONCE THIS RESIDUE COOLS IT HARDENS IN THE CONDENSER AND CANNOT BE FLUSHED BUT IT LIQUEFIES UPON CHARGING AND CLOGS THE ORIFICE TUBE
THE RESULT IS A LUBRICANT STARVED COMPRESSOR AND THE ONLY SOLUTION IS TO REPLACE THE CONDENSER

WHAT DO I DO IF MY VEHICLE STARTS TO OVER HEAT
ONCE YOU NOTICE YOUR VEHICLES TEMPERATURE IS STARTING TO CLIMB IT IS BEST TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION
FIRST THING YOU SHOULD DO IS TURN OFF YOUR AC IF YOU HAVE IT ON AND FIND A SAFE PLACE TO PULL YOUR CAR OFF THE ROAD
DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REMOVE THE RADIATOR CAP OR CHECK ANY OF THE HOSES
IT IS VERY DANGEROUS TO DO THIS UNDER THESE CONDITIONS AND YOU ARE LIKELY TO GET SEVERELY BURNED
A CAR THAT HAS OVER HEATED CAN CAUSE MASSIVE DAMAGE VERY QUICKLY
THIS IS WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO PULL OFF THE ROAD AS SOON AS YOU SAFELY CAN AND HAVE YOUR VEHICLE TOWED TO OUR SHOP FOR AN INSPECTION
HOW DO I KNOW IF MY BATTERY IS IN GOOD WORKING CONDITION
THE ARIZONA HEAT CAN BE VERY HARD ON CAR BATTERIES
A COUPLE INDICATORS THAT YOUR BATTERY MAY BE STARTING TO FAIL ARE THE CLOCK IN YOUR VEHICLE HAS BEEN RESET OR ISN'T KEEPING CORRECT TIME OR YOUR RADIO STATIONS ARE NO LONGER PROGRAMMED
YOU MAY ALSO NOTICE YOUR CAR IS SLOWER THAN USUAL TO CRANK OVER WHEN YOU START IT
HOW OFTEN SHOULD I CHANGE MY SPARK PLUGS
MOST NEW CAR MANUFACTURES RECOMMEND SPARK REPLACEMENT AT 100K MILES
OUR OPINION IS THAT BETWEEN 50K 75K MILES IS A BETTER INTERVAL
THE SPARK ELECTRODES WEAR OUT BEFORE THE HIGHER MILEAGE AND THIS CAN CAUSE WEAR ON OTHER PARTS WE FREQUENTLY SEE COILS NEEDING REPLACEMENT ON ENGINES WITH HIGH MILEAGE PLUGS
WHY DOES MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COME ON
THE CHECK ENGINE OR SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT ILLUMINATES TO ALERT YOU THAT THE COMPUTER HAS DETECTED A MALFUNCTION IN A FUEL IGNITION OR EMISSION CONTROL CIRCUIT
YOU SHOULD HAVE THIS PROBLEM DIAGNOSED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IF THE LIGHT STARTS FLASHING YOUR CAR'S COMPUTER HAS DETECTED AN ENGINE MISS THAT COULD LEAD TO CATALYTIC CONVERTER DAMAGE IF YOU CONTINUE USING THE VEHICLE
EVEN IF THE CAR SEEMS TO STILL BE WORKING AS IT WAS BEFORE THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON IT IS IMPORTANT TO GET THE ISSUE CHECKED BY A PROFESSIONAL

THE BATTERY CHARGE LOW OR BATT LOW WARNING MESSAGE ON MY DASH IS ON
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN AND WHAT SHOULD I DO
BATTERY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM CERTAIN HONDA VEHICLES ARE EQUIPPED WITH A BATTERY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
THIS SYSTEM MONITORS THE BATTERY'S STATE OF CHARGE SOC AND ALERTS THE DRIVER WHEN IT HAS DROPPED BELOW A PREDETERMINED LEVEL VIA A SERIES OF MESSAGES ON THE MULTI INFORMATION DISPLAY MID
THESE MESSAGES INCLUDE BATTERY CHARGE LOW BATT LOW AND CHANGE BATTERY OR REPLACE BATTERY
CONDITIONS THAT WOULD CAUSE THE BATTERY'S SOC TO DROP INCLUDE LONG-TERM VEHICLE STORAGE ACCESSORY USE WHEN THE ENGINE IS NOT RUNNING AND FREQUENT SHORT TRIPS
BATTERY CHARGE LOW AND BATT LOW MESSAGES IF THESE CONDITIONS ARE PRESENT AND THE BATTERY CHARGE IS LOW YOU WILL SEE THE BATTERY CHARGE LOW AND BATT LOW MESSAGES ON YOUR MID
IF YOU ARE USING ACCESSORIES SUCH AS THE AUDIO SYSTEM AND INTERIOR LIGHTS WITHOUT THE ENGINE RUNNING WHEN YOU SEE THESE MESSAGES WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU TURN OFF THE IGNITION AND REMOVE THE KEY IMMEDIATELY TO PRESERVE REMAINING BATTERY POWER UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE
IT IS POSSIBLE IN THIS INSTANCE THAT THE SOC WILL BE TOO LOW TO START THE VEHICLE BUT MOST LIKELY THERE WILL BE ENOUGH CHARGE LEFT TO START THE VEHICLE IF YOU STOP USING THE ACCESSORIES AS SOON AS THE MESSAGE APPEARS
THESE MESSAGES SIMPLY MEAN THAT THE BATTERY CHARGE IS LOWER THAN IT SHOULD BE
ONCE THE SOC INCREASES THESE MESSAGES WILL DISAPPEAR
IF THE SOC SUFFICIENTLY DROPS WHILE YOU ARE DRIVING THE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM WILL RAISE YOUR IDLE SPEED IN AN EFFORT TO INCREASE ALTERNATOR OUTPUT THEREBY CHARGING THE BATTERY
IF YOU ARE REGULARLY SEEING THESE MESSAGES WHEN THE DESCRIBED CONDITIONS ARE NOT PRESENT YOUR VEHICLE MAY NEED ITS SOFTWARE UPDATED
YOUR LOCAL HONDA DEALER'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT CAN HELP TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE
CHANGE BATTERY AND REPLACE BATTERY MESSAGES IF THE BATTERY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DETERMINES THE BATTERY IS CLOSE TO EXHAUSTING ITS USEFUL LIFE IT MAY GENERATE A MESSAGE INDICATING CHANGE BATTERY OR REPLACE BATTERY
THE SYSTEM MONITORS BATTERY FLOW AND VOLTAGE AND IF IT DETERMINES THAT THE BATTERY CANNOT MAINTAIN ITS SOC IT WILL SEND THESE MESSAGES TO THE MID TO DISPLAY FOR THE DRIVER
IF YOU RECEIVE THIS MESSAGE ON YOUR MID WE RECOMMEND VISITING YOUR HONDA DEALERSHIP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO HAVE THE BATTERY INSPECTED AND IF NEEDED REPLACED
YOU CAN HELP PRESERVE YOUR BATTERY'S LIFE AND CHARGE BY MINIMIZING SHORT TRIPS WHEN POSSIBLE AND LIMITING YOUR USE OF ACCESSORIES WHEN THE ENGINE IS NOT RUNNING
IF YOU EVER HAVE A CONCERN WITH YOUR BATTERY PLEASE SEE YOUR HONDA DEALERSHIP

HOW DO I KNOW IF I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MY TRANSMISSION
SLIPPAGE IS ONE OF THE FIRST SIGNS OF A FAILING TRANSMISSION
IF YOU PUT YOUR FOOT ON THE GAS AND IT TAKES YOUR CAR MORE THAN A SECOND TO START MOVING THEN YOUR TRANSMISSION IS SLIPPING

IT IS IMPORTANT TO BRING YOUR TRUCK IN FOR SERVICE AT THE FIRST SIGNS OF SLIPPING BECAUSE WE MAY BE ABLE TO HELP YOU AVOID A PRICEY TRANSMISSION REPLACEMENT
EVEN IF YOUR TRANSMISSION NEEDS TO BE REPLACED IT IS BEST TO TAKE CARE OF IT EARLY BECAUSE IT MAY FAIL AT AN INOPPORTUNE TIME AND OR RUIN OTHER PARTS OF YOUR DRIVE TRAIN
