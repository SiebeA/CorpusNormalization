HOW OFTEN SHOULD I GET AN OIL CHANGE
THE CONSENSUS AGREES THAT A DRIVER SHOULD GET AN OIL CHANGE EVERY THREE THOUSAND TO SEVEN THOUSAND MILES OR EVERY THREE MONTHS
HOWEVER YOU CAN ALWAYS REFER TO YOUR OWNER'S MANUAL WHICH COVERS THE RECOMMENDED OIL CHANGE INTERVAL FOR YOUR SPECIFIC MAKE AND MODEL
MANY OF TODAY'S NEWER VEHICLES WILL ACTUALLY TELL YOU WHEN THEY ARE DUE FOR SERVICE
REMEMBER AN OIL CHANGE IS ESSENTIAL BECAUSE IT ACTS AS A LUBRICANT FOR THE INTERNAL COGS AND GEARS UNDER THE HOOD
WITHOUT IT OIL CAN TURN INTO SLUDGE AND PROHIBIT YOUR VEHICLE FROM OPERATING CORRECTLY
OUR ORGANIZATION'S NAME IS BMW
AND WE ORGANIZE VERY NEATLY
