the Battery charge low or BATT LOW warning message on my dash is on . what does that mean and what should I do ? battery Management System Certain Honda vehicles are equipped with a Battery Management System . this system monitors the battery's state of charge ( SOC ) and alerts the driver when it has dropped below a predetermined level via a series of messages on the multi-information display ( MID ) . these messages include Battery charge low , batt low , and CHANGE BATTERY or REPLACE BATTERY . conditions that would cause the battery's SOC to drop include long-term vehicle storage , accessory use when the engine is not running , and frequent short trips . battery charge low and BATT LOW Messages If these conditions are present and the battery charge is low , you will see the Battery charge low and BATT LOW messages on your MID . if you are using accessories , such as the audio system and interior lights , without the engine running when you see these messages , we recommend that you turn off the ignition and remove the key immediately to preserve remaining battery power until you are ready to drive the vehicle . it is possible in this instance that the SOC will be too low to start the vehicle , but most likely there will be enough charge left to start the vehicle if you stop using the accessories as soon as the message appears . these messages simply mean that the battery charge is lower than it should be . once the SOC increases , these messages will disappear . if the SOC sufficiently drops while you are driving , the engine control system will raise your idle speed in an effort to increase alternator output , thereby charging the battery . if you are regularly seeing these messages when the described conditions are not present , your vehicle may need its software updated . your local Honda dealer's service department can help to address this issue . CHANGE BATTERY and REPLACE BATTERY Messages If the Battery Management System determines the battery is close to exhausting its useful life , it may generate a message indicating CHANGE BATTERY or REPLACE BATTERY . the system monitors battery flow and voltage , and if it determines that the battery cannot maintain its SOC , it will send these messages to the MID to display for the driver . if you receive this message on your MID , we recommend visiting your Honda dealership as soon as possible to have the battery inspected and , if needed , replaced . you can help preserve your battery's life and charge by minimizing short trips when possible and limiting your use of accessories when the engine is not running . if you ever have a concern with your battery , please see your Honda dealership .
