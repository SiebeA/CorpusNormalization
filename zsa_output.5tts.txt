The Battery charge low or BATT LOW warning message on my dash is on .
What does that mean and what should I do ?
Battery Management System Certain Honda vehicles are equipped with a Battery Management System .
This system monitors the battery 's state of charge S.O.C. and alerts the driver when it has dropped below a predetermined level via a series of messages on the multi- information display MID .
These messages include Battery charge low , batt low , and CHANGE BATTERY or REPLACE BATTERY .
Conditions that would cause the battery 's S.O.C. to drop include long-term vehicle storage , accessory use when the engine is not running , and frequent short trips .
Battery charge low and BATT LOW Messages If these conditions are present and the battery charge is low , you will see the Battery charge low and BATT LOW messages on your MID .
If you are using accessories , such as the audio system and interior lights , without the engine running when you see these messages , we recommend that you turn off the ignition and remove the key immediately to preserve remaining battery power until you are ready to drive the vehicle .
It is possible in this instance that the S.O.C. will be too low to start the vehicle , but most likely there will be enough charge left to start the vehicle if you stop using the accessories as soon as the message appears .
These messages simply mean that the battery charge is lower than it should be .
Once the S.O.C. increases , these messages will disappear .
If the S.O.C. sufficiently drops while you are driving , the engine control system will raise your idle speed in an effort to increase alternator output , thereby charging the battery .
If you are regularly seeing these messages when the described conditions are not present , your vehicle may need its software updated .
Your local Honda dealer 's service department can help to address this issue .
CHANGE BATTERY and REPLACE BATTERY Messages If the Battery Management System determines the battery is close to exhausting its useful life , it may generate a message indicating CHANGE BATTERY or REPLACE BATTERY .
The system monitors battery flow and voltage , and if it determines that the battery cannot maintain its S.O.C. , it will send these messages to the MID to display for the driver .
If you receive this message on your MID , we recommend visiting your Honda dealership as soon as possible to have the battery inspected and , if needed , replaced .
You can help preserve your battery 's life and charge by minimizing short trips when possible and limiting your use of accessories when the engine is not running .
If you ever have a concern with your battery , please see your Honda dealership .

How do I know if I have a problem with my transmission ?
Slippage is one of the first signs of a failing transmission .
If you put your foot on the gas and it takes your car more than a second to start moving then your transmission is slipping .

It is important to bring your truck in for service at the first signs of slipping because we may be able to help you avoid a pricey transmission replacement .
